## Important

This repository contains the original [Peru COVID Surveillance data](Peru_COVID_Surveillance/data/). The CSV files have been
compressed using the xz format to save space. Because a couple of the
files are over the usual Github limit of 50MB, this repository is making use of
LFS (Large File Support).

See more details in LFS at the Github documentation on [Managing Large Files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)
